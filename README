Changes from original framework:

	-Rather than use MPPKI, the new framework only considers miss-rate

	-The new framework models an in order processor

	-Traces now only consist of branch information to decrease trace size

	-The multiple runs have been reduced to one


See http://www.jilp.org/jwac-2/ for info on the original framework.
