This framework is based on the framework provided here: 
http://www.jilp.org/jwac-2/ please contact the original authors with questions.

Build:
This framework requires the following libraries:
- boost IOstreams
- boost Program Options
- libz
On a debian based system:
apt-get installbboost-program-options-dev libboost-iostreams-dev zlib1g-dev

Running:
./cbp3_example.exe -t traces/CLIENT01.trace

Predictors are implemented in C++ and create a library.
To build the example, execute make in the top level directory.
To add a new predictor:
- Copy the example directory. 
	cp ./predictors/example ./predictors/my_pred
- Use modify Conditional.cpp and Indirect.cpp to implement your logic.
- Build your new predictor
	make PRED=my_pred
